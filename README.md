# Mothership

The nurturing place to dev and launch your project.

### Local Development

This frontend is designed to be run as part of the integrated Mothership development environment.

To start the frontend for local development, please use the `docker-compose.dev.yml` file located at the root of the `Workahub_Backend_Reloaded` repository. Instructions can be found in the main `README.md` file for that repository.
